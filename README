# ESPHamClock (Community Mirror)

ESPHamClock is an ESP-based implementation of **HamClock**, a widely used amateur radio clock and situational awareness display.

This repository is a **community-maintained mirror** of the ESPHamClock source code, preserved under the original MIT license to ensure continued availability, transparency, and community contribution.

## 🕊 In Memoriam

This project is dedicated to the memory of  
**Elwood Downey, WB0OEW**

Elwood was the creator of HamClock and a tremendous contributor to the amateur radio community.  
His work helped thousands of operators better understand propagation, timing, and global radio conditions.

This repository exists to **preserve his work**, honor his contributions, and ensure the community can continue to learn from and build upon what he created.

## 📡 About ESPHamClock

ESPHamClock is a **client application**. It aggregates and visualizes information from multiple **independent, public, and community-run data sources**, including:

- DX Cluster nodes (ham-run, distributed)
- NTP servers for accurate timekeeping
- NOAA / NASA space weather feeds
- Public amateur radio reference services
- Optional GPS hardware (via gpsd)

> **There is no single central backend server required for ESPHamClock to operate.**

If any individual external data source becomes unavailable, only the related feature may degrade; the application itself continues to function.

## 🧠 Clarifying a Common Misconception

Some users have expressed concern that ESPHamClock depends on a single author-operated backend server.

**This is not the case.**

- ESPHamClock does **not** require a proprietary server to run
- It does **not** authenticate, license, or “phone home”
- DX Cluster data comes from **independent, volunteer-run cluster nodes**
- Time synchronization uses standard **NTP pools**
- Solar and propagation data comes from **public scientific institutions**

The original author hosted **distribution and support infrastructure** (such as downloads and documentation), but the runtime operation of ESPHamClock does **not** depend on that infrastructure.
